# Kubernetes

## Setup

Create a `aws.json` file in this directory that contains the following
information. You need to gather the AWS key.

```
{
    "AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID": "",
    "AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY": "",
    "AWS_DEFAULT_REGION": "us-west-2"
}
```

## Accessing `kubectl`

To access `kubectl` go into `prod` and run the following:

```
make config
```

This will generate a `KUBECONFIG` file called `kubeconfig`.

To access kubernetes then run the following:

```
cd prod
make config
export KUBECONFIG=./kubeconfig
kubectl get pods
```
